# Software Requirement Specification (SRS) - RedBus

Welcome to the **Software Requirement Specification (SRS)** repository for the **RedBus** application. This repository contains the detailed software requirements and documentation for RedBus, an online bus ticket booking system. 

The goal of this project was to document the **functional** and **non-functional** requirements, **user interactions**, and **system design** to serve as a foundation for future development.

---

## Project Overview

This repository includes the following key components:
1. **SRS Document**: A complete Software Requirement Specification document outlining the functional and non-functional requirements.
2. **Use Case Diagrams**: Visual representation of interactions between users and the system.
3. **Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)**: Diagrams illustrating the flow of data within the system.
4. **Class Diagrams**: A representation of the system structure, showcasing the system's architecture.
5. **Test Cases**: A collection of test cases designed to validate the core functionality of the system.

## Project Description

The **RedBus** project focuses on building an online ticket booking platform for buses. The system enables users to:
- Search for buses and available routes.
- Book tickets for a selected bus and seat.
- Make payments using various methods.
- Receive confirmation of booking via email.
- Track buses in real-time.
- Access customer support for resolving booking issues.

This repository contains the **Software Requirement Specification (SRS)** document for the system. The SRS document outlines the necessary details, including system functions, constraints, design, and interaction between the users and the system.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

- **SRS_Document.pdf**: The complete Software Requirement Specification document for the RedBus system.
- **Use_Case_Diagrams/**: Folder containing use case diagrams representing key user interactions with the system.
- **Data_Flow_Diagrams/**: Folder containing Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) to represent the flow of data in the system.
- **Class_Diagrams/**: Folder containing the class diagrams that describe the system architecture.
- **Testing/**: Folder containing test cases and parameters for validating core system functionalities like login, registration, and booking.
